# Summary
Will be provided after publication.

# Data availability
Processed and raw ChIP-seq data will be available after publication via the Gene Expression Omnibus under the accession number GSE205933.
Processed and raw bulk RNA sequencing data will be available after publication via the Gene Expression Omnibus under the accession number GSE216891.

# Software
Raw bulk RNA sequencing files were mapped to mouse reference genome GRCm39 with Spliced Transcripts Alignment to Reference (STAR, version 2.7.10a), and processing and analysis were performed with DESeq2 (version 1.36.0). 
ChIP-seq raw files were mapped to the mouse genome (mm10) using Bowtie2 (version 2.4.2). Peak calling, peak annotation, and motif analysis were performed with HOMER tools (version 4.11).
